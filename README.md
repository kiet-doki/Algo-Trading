## Project 1: Equal-Weight S&P 500 Screener

The first project focuses on the S&P 500, a widely followed index comprising 500 large-cap U.S. companies. Unlike the traditional market-capitalization-weighted approach, this project takes a different approach by equally weighting all companies in the index. By doing so, it offers an alternative perspective on the performance of the S&P 500, where each company's influence is identical, regardless of its size.

## Project 2: Quantitative Momentum Screener

In the second project, I delve into the world of quantitative momentum investing. This strategy involves investing in assets that have shown the most significant price increase over a specific period. Through data-driven analysis, this project aims to uncover potential investment opportunities with impressive price momentum, providing valuable insights into promising assets.

## Project 3: Quantitative Value Screener

The third project explores quantitative value investing strategies. Value investing focuses on identifying undervalued stocks in the market. To achieve this, I rely on the concept of multiples, which involves comparing a company's stock price to various measures of its worth, such as earnings or assets. By employing multiple valuation strategies and using a composite approach, this project aims to develop algorithmic value investing strategies that can potentially outperform traditional methods.
